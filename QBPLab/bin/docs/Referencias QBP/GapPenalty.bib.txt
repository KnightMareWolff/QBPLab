abstract={The Smith-Waterman algorithm is widely used in bioinformatics and is often used as a benchmark of FPGA performance. Here we present our highly optimized Smith-Waterman implementation on Intel FPGAs using OpenCL. Our implementation is both faster and more efficient than other current Smith-Waterman implementations, obtaining a theoretical performance of 214 GCUPS. Moreover, due to the streaming, implicit synchronizing nature of our implementation, which streams alignments and places no restrictions on the number of alignments in flight, it achieves 99.8% of this performance in practice, almost three times as fast as previous implementations. The expressiveness of OpenCL results in a significant reduction in lines of code, and in a significant reduction of development time compared to programming in regular hardware description languages.},

abstract={The emergence of bioinformatics has led to many new discoveries in living organisms. These discoveries would not have been possible without the developments made in the sequence alignment techniques. Many sequence alignment algorithms were developed to make the alignment process fast and accurate. However, the more precise algorithms take longer than their less precise counterparts. Researchers came with innovative approaches to combat the time consuming constraint. Their aim was to speed up the computational process by using more efficient implementations of the algorithms using state-of-the-art hardware platforms. Smith Waterman (SW) algorithm, being the most accurate in the alignment process, has been implemented on various high performance computing platforms for the same purpose. However, the intrinsic structure of the algorithm has got little attention. In this paper, we present a novel structure of the SW algorithm that takes less number of cycles at the cost of utilizing a minimal amount of extra hardware resources as compared to its existing form. The newly proposed architecture achieves up to 25% performance gain.},

abstract={The maximal sensitivity of the Smith-Waterman algorithm has enabled its wide use in biological sequence database search. Unfortunately, the high sensitivity comes at the expense of quadratic time complexity, which makes the algorithm computationally demanding for big databases. In this paper, we present SWAPHI, the first parallelized algorithm employing the emerging Xeon Phis to accelerate Smith-Waterman protein database search. SWAPHI is designed based on the scale-and-vectorize approach, i.e. it boosts alignment speed by effectively utilizing both the coarse-grained parallelism from the many co-processing cores (scale) and the fine-grained parallelism from 512-bit wide single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vectors per core (vectorize). By searching against the large UniProtKB/TrEMBL protein database, SWAPHI achieves a performance of up to 58.8 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS) on a single Xeon Phi and up to 228.4 GCUPS on four Xeon Phis. Moreover, SWAPHI using four Xeon Phis is superior to both SWIPE on 16 highend CPU cores and BLAST+ on 8 cores, with the maximum speedup of 1.52 and 1.86, respectively. SWAPHI is freely available at http://swaphi.sourceforge.net.},

abstract={More sensitive than heuristic methods for searching biological databases, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is widely used, but it has a high quadratic running time. This work presents a faster approach and implementation for Smith-Waterman that extends the traditional results to return multiple, BLAST-like sub-alignments. The extended Smith-Waterman using Associative Massive Parallelism (SWAMP+) is introduced for three different parallel architectures: Associative Computing (ASC), the Clear Speed coprocessor, and the Convey Computer FPGA coprocessor. We show that parallel versions of Smith-Waterman can be successfully modified to produce multiple BLAST-like sub-alignments while maintaining the original Smith-Waterman sensitivity. This approach combines parallelism and the novel extension to produce multiple sub-alignments for pair wise comparisons. The two parallel SWAMP+ implementations for the ASC model and the Clear Speed CSX-620 use a wave front approach. Both perform a full trace back in the parallel memory and return multiple subsequence alignment results. Results show a linear speedup for the 96 processing elements (PEs) on a single Clear Speed chip. The third approach is a SWAMP+ adaptation that uses the non-associative Convey FPGA coprocessor. This allows for an initial high-speed, high-throughput Smith-Waterman alignment on the hybrid system optimized for large databases. The additional pair wise alignments are run to produce the additional SWAMP+ sub-alignments. The overall results across the three systems are parallel implementations of an extended Smith-Waterman that maintain a speedup and provide a deeper exploration of the query sequences not previously available.},

abstract={The Smith-Waterman algorithm is very sensitive but computationally intensive on general purpose CPUs. On the other hand, the FPGA has proven to be an excellent platform for accelerating the algorithm in addition to its low cost and power consumption. This paper therefore proposes the use of the parallelism and carry-free propagation properties of Residue Number Systems (RNS) to accelerate the algorithm on an FPGA; a deviation from the usual binary/decimal implementations. Compared to the only previous known work that uses RNS for this task, our implementation is (1) the first to employ the use of Linear Systolic Arrays (LSA), (2) avoid the use of Lookup Tables, (3) has a larger dynamic range and (4) aligns long sequences. Implemented on a modest hardware and on a Kintex7 FPGA, we achieved a performance improvement of 169 times over the general-purpose processor implementation. This result was obtained using the naïve implementation of LSAs, indicating the positive effects of using RNS.},

abstract={The Smith-Waterman algorithm, which produces the optimal local alignment between pairwise sequences, is universally used as a key component in bioinformatics fields. It is more sensitive than heuristic approaches, but also more time-consuming. To speed up the algorithm, Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions have been used to parallelize the algorithm by leveraging data parallel strategy. However, SIMD-based Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithms show limited scalability. Moreover, the recent next-generation sequencing machines generate sequences at an unprecedented rate, so faster implementations of the sequence alignment algorithms are needed to keep pace. In this paper, we present CloudSW, an efficient distributed Smith-Waterman algorithm which leverages Apache Spark and SIMD instructions to accelerate the algorithm. To facilitate easy integration of distributed Smith-Waterman algorithm into third-party software, we provide application programming interfaces (APIs) service in cloud. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) CloudSW has outstanding performance and achieves up to 3.29 times speedup over DSW and 621 times speedup over SparkSW. 2) CloudSW has excellent scalability and achieves up to 529 giga cell updates per second (GCUPS) in protein database search with 50 nodes in Aliyun Cloud, which is the highest performance that has been reported as far as we know.},

abstract={The Smith-Waterman is one of the most popular algorithms in the molecular sequence alignment. It is often used to find the best local alignment between two strings by calculating the similarity score of the pair of strings. The algorithm is of great potential to be parallelized and has been employed by a lot of FPGA-based solutions, mostly with the systolic array manner. However, the architecture designers always find the number of the process elements (PE) in their implementation quite limited by the resources available on the FPGA devices. They either make decomposition or fold the implementation of their applications when facing a large requirement for the process elements number. In this paper, we put forward a novel FPGA-based architecture which could address the problem with a bounded number of PEs to realize any lengths of systolic array. It is mainly based on the idea of the banded Smith-Waterman but with a key distinguish that it reuses the PEs which are beyond the boundary. Analysis shows that the approach is as fast as the normal systolic fabric and obtains quite considerable resource reduction.},

abstract={Duplicate detection is a process of identifying a pair of words that refers to the same real-word object. Generally, words consist of letters that have a syntax representation. In most cases, words, such as names, are incorrectly spelt during data entry and that creates duplicate data and if it is unresolved could lead to inconsistency of data. Fundamental algorithms that are applied in the design of duplicate detection systems includes Smith-Waterman and Jaro-Winkler algorithms. The study compares and analyses the application of Smith-Waterman algorithm and Jaro-Winkler algorithm to find duplicate words in large dataset such as health dataset. The basis for comparison is to find how accurate these algorithms are in detecting duplicate words in large health dataset. The contribution of this paper is the use of transitive and symmetry property on both Smith-Waterman and Jaro-Winkler algorithm when large dataset is involved in the duplicate detection processes.},

abstract={Finding regions of similarity between two data streams is a computational intensive and memory consuming problem, which refers to as sequence alignment for biological sequence. Smith-Waterman algorithm is an optimal method to find the local sequence alignment. It requires a large amount of computation and memory, and is also constrained by the memory access speed when accelerated by using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). A new method to implement Smith-Waterman algorithm with two-dimensional cache is proposed, which aims at accelerating the first stage of Smith-Waterman algorithm and coalesced writing back the corresponding results to GPU global memory. Our proposal is implemented over NVIDIA Geforce GTX295 GPU, and compared with CUDASW++ 2.0. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms CUDASW++ 2.0 in the datasets chosen from NCBI.},

abstract={The Smith Waterman algorithm for sequence alignment is one of the main tools of bioinformatics. It is used for sequence similarity searches and alignment of similar sequences. The high end graphical processing unit (GPU), used for processing graphics on desktop computers, deliver computational capabilities exceeding those of CPUs by an order of magnitude. Recently these capabilities became accessible for general purpose computations thanks to CUDA programming environment on Nvidia GPUs and ATI Stream Computing environment on ATI GPUs. Here we present an efficient implementation of the Smith Waterman algorithm on the Nvidia GPU.

abstract={An effort has been underway to develop a system for de novo sequencing of single DNA molecules with very long reads. The system operates by optically detecting the passage of fluorescently tagged DNA bases through a detection zone. A successful system would be revolutionary with respect to speed, read length, cost and minimized laboratory infrastructure. An important part of system development is modeling of the detection process. In particular, predicting the expected error from a set of sequencing parameters is helpful in system design. This paper describes variations on the Smith-Waterman algorithm for subsequence alignment used in a single-molecule detection model. The alignment algorithm is used to check the modeled output sequence generated from a known input sequence. Variations based on reasonable assumptions led to over an order of magnitude improvement in alignment speed},
